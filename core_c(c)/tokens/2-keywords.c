/*
Keywords, also known as reserved words, are predefined words in a programming language that have special meanings and purposes. These words are reserved by the language and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names or function names) because they are already used for specific language features or functionalities. In C programming, there are a set of keywords that are recognized by the compiler and have predefined meanings.

auto: Specifies automatic storage duration for variables. It is rarely used in modern programming because automatic storage duration is the default behavior for local variables.

break: Used to exit from a loop or switch statement. When encountered, it causes the program's control to exit the loop or switch statement it is present in.

case: Used in switch statements to specify different cases. It labels different blocks of code to be executed based on the value of an expression.

char: Declares a character data type. It is used to represent single characters, typically one byte in size.

const: Specifies that a variable's value cannot be changed. It is used to define constants in programs.

continue: Skips the rest of the loop and continues with the next iteration. When encountered, it skips the remaining code in the loop's body and starts the next iteration of the loop.

default: Specifies the default case in a switch statement. It is executed when none of the other cases match the value of the expression in the switch statement.

do: Starts a do-while loop. It executes a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition becomes false.

double: Declares a double-precision floating-point data type. It is used to represent floating-point numbers with double precision.

else: Specifies an alternative statement in an if-else statement. It is executed when the condition specified in the if statement evaluates to false.

enum: Declares an enumeration data type. It is used to define a set of named integer constants.

extern: Specifies that a variable or function is declared elsewhere in the program. It is used to declare variables or functions that are defined in other files.

float: Declares a floating-point data type. It is used to represent floating-point numbers with single precision.

for: Starts a for loop. It is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times.

goto: Transfers control to a labeled statement. It is rarely used in modern programming due to its tendency to make code less readable and harder to maintain.

if: Starts an if statement. It is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.

int: Declares an integer data type. It is used to represent integer numbers.

long: Declares a long integer data type. It is used to represent integer numbers with extended range.

register: Specifies that a variable should be stored in a CPU register if possible. It is rarely used in modern programming as compilers are typically better at optimizing register usage than programmers.

return: Exits a function and returns a value. It is used to exit a function prematurely and return a value to the calling code.

short: Declares a short integer data type. It is used to represent integer numbers with a smaller range than the int data type.

signed: Declares a signed data type. It is used to indicate that a data type can represent both positive and negative numbers.

sizeof: Returns the size of a variable or data type. It is used to determine the size, in bytes, of a variable or data type.

static: Specifies that a variable retains its value between function calls. It is used to declare variables that have a persistent value across function calls.

struct: Declares a structure data type. It is used to define a composite data type that groups together variables of different types.

switch: Starts a switch statement. It is used to execute one of multiple blocks of code based on the value of an expression.

typedef: Creates a new data type using an existing data type. It is used to define aliases for existing data types to improve code readability and maintainability.

union: Declares a union data type. It is used to define a data type that can hold variables of different types, but only one at a time.

unsigned: Declares an unsigned data type. It is used to indicate that a data type can only represent positive numbers.

void: Specifies that a function does not return a value or a pointer to void. It is used to indicate that a function does not return a value or that a pointer does not have a specific data type.

volatile: Specifies that a variable can be modified by external sources. It is used to indicate that a variable's value can be changed unexpectedly, such as by hardware interrupts or other threads.
