Exception handling in C++ provides a mechanism to handle runtime errors or exceptional situations gracefully, rather than letting the program crash. It allows you to separate error-handling code from the regular code, improving code readability and maintainability. 

Try-Catch Blocks : 

The basic syntax for handling exceptions in C++ involves try, catch, and optionally throw:

syntax :

try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType1& e1) {
    // Code to handle ExceptionType1
} catch (ExceptionType2& e2) {
    // Code to handle ExceptionType2
} catch (...) {
    // Catch-all block for handling any other type of exception
}


try: Encloses the code that might throw an exception.

catch: Catches and handles exceptions of a specific type. Multiple catch blocks can follow a try block, each handling different types of exceptions.

throw: Used to explicitly throw an exception. It can be followed by an object that describes the exception.
